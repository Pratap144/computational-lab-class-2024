Hello there! My name is S S Pratap Tanari, but you can call me Sundar. I am from India and I'm glad to meet you all. I am an introvert basically, so feel free to throw a hi because i cannot (but I try a lot trust me!). FUN FACT: I caught my first flight (yes! you heard that right) and this is my first time coming to the US and I'm already liking it here.
